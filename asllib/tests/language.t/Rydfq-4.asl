//R_YDFQ: Where the left hand side of an assignment is to an identifier
//which is declared as a setter, the assignment is treated in the same way
//as a procedure invocation. In this case, if a sequence of
//null_or_slice_lists is present, each must consist of a single expression.
//The sequence of null_or_slice_lists shall be used as the actual
//expressions for the invocation of the setter. 


    DHCSR = Zeros(32); //  call unparameterized setter function `DHCSR`
