\chapter{Disclaimer}

This document is part of the ASLRef material, maintained in the
\href{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7}{herdtools7 GitHub repository}.

This material covers ASL1, a new version of ASL.
In addition to the release of this document, Arm actively contributes to
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7}.

The sequential definition of the ASL1 language is at \TERM{EAC} quality as per Arm’s quality standards, meaning it includes all features in full detail and is stable enough to serve as the definitive source for development, with only clarifications or defect fixes under exceptional circumstances expected.
The concurrent definition of the ASL1 language is work in progress, at \TERM{DEV} quality as per Arm's quality standards.
This means that it would be premature to base any production tool development on the concurrent definition of the ASL1 language.

We welcome feedback, questions, and feature requests — please contact us by writing
to (\href{mailto:atg-formal@arm.com}{\tt atg-formal@arm.com}) or raise issues and
pull requests to the \href{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7}{herdtools7 GitHub repository}.
