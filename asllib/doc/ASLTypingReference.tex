experimental, and as yet unreleased version of ASL.

This material is work in progress, more precisely at pre-Alpha quality as
per Arm’s quality standards. In particular, this means that it would be
premature to base any production tool development on this material.

\chapter{Preamble}

\section{Environments}

\section{Annotation}
Typing a program is typing its ``main'' subprogram.  Constructively, typing a
program requires following its Abstract Syntax Tree and typing each of its
components.

The types of a program are given by applying a set of
\texttt{annotate\_<object>} functions. Each \texttt{annotate\_<object>}
function describes how to annotate a specific object, as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{annotate\_expr} annotates expressions;
\item \texttt{annotate\_slices} annotates slices;
\item \texttt{annotate\_pattern} annotates pattern;
\item \texttt{annotate\_local\_decl\_item} annotates local declarations;
\item \texttt{annotate\_lexpr} annotates left-hand sides of assignments;
\item \texttt{annotate\_stmt} annotates statements;
\item \texttt{annotate\_block} annotates blocks;
\item \texttt{annotate\_catcher} annotates catchers;
\item \texttt{annotate\_call} annotates functions calls;
\item \texttt{annotate\_func} annotates functions.
\end{itemize}

This aims to encompass LRM 7.4.2. R\_VDPC.

\section{Reading guide}

The definition of each \texttt{annotation\_<object>} function is given by a number of
rules, which follow the possible shapes the \texttt{object} can have. For 
example, an expression can be a literal, or a binary operator, amongst other
things. Each of those has its own evaluation rule: TypingRule.Lit in
Section~\ref{sec:TypingRule.Lit}, Typing.Binop in
Section~\ref{sec:TypingRule.Binop} respectively.

Each rule is presented using the following template:
\begin{itemize}
\item a Prose paragraph gives the rule in English, and corresponds as much as possible to the code of the reference implementation ASLRef given at \url{~/herdtools7/asllib};
\item one or several Examples, which as much as possible are also given as regression tests in \url{~/herdtools7/asllib/tests/ASLTypingReference.t}
\item a Code paragraph which gives a verbatim of the corresponding implementation in the type-checker of ASLRef \url{~/herdtools7/asllib/Typing.ml};
\item Formal paragraphs which give formal definitions of the rule.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Abstract Syntax}
In order to type both ASLv0 and ASLv1, we map the concrete syntax of both versions into an abstract syntax, which is a form of labelled tree. The abstract syntax tree abstracts away many syntactic elements that are only needed to enable parsing.

\newcommand\BNOT[0]{\texttt{"!"}}
\newcommand\NEG[0]{\texttt{"-"}}
\newcommand\NOT[0]{\texttt{"NOT"}}

\newcommand\unop[0]{\textrm{unop}}
\newcommand\binop[0]{\textrm{binop}}
\newcommand\binopin[0]{\textrm{binop\_in}}
\newcommand\binoppow[0]{\textrm{binop\_pow}}

% AST-only nodes
\newcommand\literal[0]{\texttt{literal}}
\newcommand\expr[0]{\texttt{expr}}

%The following node types directly correspond to their respective ASL grammar variables (non-terminals):  $\unop$, $\binop$, $\binopin$, $\binoppow$
The following node types directly correspond to their respective ASL grammar variables (non-terminals):  $\unop$, $\binop$, $\binopin$, $\binoppow$

\[
%\unop = \BNOT \;|\; \NEG \;|\; \NOT
\begin{array}{rcl}
\literal &=& \texttt{<int\_lit>} \;|\; \texttt{<boolean\_lit>} \;|\; \texttt{<real\_lit>} \;|\; \texttt{<bitvector\_lit>} \;|\; \texttt{<string\_lit>}\\
\expr &=& \texttt{E\_Literal}(literal) \;|\; \texttt{E\_Var}(\texttt{<identifier>})
\end{array}
\]

TODO: what about \texttt{hex\_lit}?

\section{TypingRule.BuiltinSingularType \label{sec:TypingRule.BuiltinSingularType}}

    \subsection{Prose}
    The \emph{builtin singular types} are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item integer;
    \item real;
    \item string;
    \item boolean;
    \item bits;
    \item enumeration.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Example: TypingRule.BuiltinSingularTypes.asl}
\VerbatimInput[firstline=3,lastline=8]{\tests/TypingRule.BuiltinSingularTypes.asl}
Variables of  buitin types \texttt{integer}, \texttt{real}, \texttt{boolean}, \texttt{bits(4)} and \texttt{bits(2)} are defined.

    \subsection{Example: TypingRule.EnumerationType.asl}
\VerbatimInput{\tests/TypingRule.EnumerationType.asl}
The type \texttt{color} consists in two different constants \texttt{RED} and~\texttt{BLACK}.

\section{TypingRule.BuiltinAggregateType \label{sec:TypingRule.BuiltinAggregateType}}

    \subsection{Prose}
    The builtin aggregate types are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item tuple;
    \item array;
    \item record;
    \item exception.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Example: TypingRule.BuiltinAggregateTypes.asl}
      \VerbatimInput{\tests/TypingRule.BuiltinAggregateTypes.asl}
      Type \texttt{pair} is the type of integer and booleans pairs. Notice that
      the syntax of types and expressions are similar.

Arrays are indexed either by integers from 0 to array size as specified in type
declaration, as illustrated by the type \texttt{T}, or by the elements of an
enumeration type, as illustrated by type~\texttt{pointCoord}.

The type~\texttt{pointRecord} is defined as a record type with  three fields
\texttt{x}, \texttt{y} and~\texttt{z}.

    \subsection{Example: TypingRule.BuiltinExceptionType.asl}
    \VerbatimInput{\tests/TypingRule.BuiltinExceptionType.asl}
    Two exception types are defined: exceptions \texttt{Not\_found} carry no
values, while exceptions \texttt{Error}  carry a messsage. Notice the
similarity with record types and that the empty field list \texttt{\{\}} can be
omitted in type declarations, as it is the case for \texttt{Not\_found}.

    \item All of the following apply:

      \item \texttt{ty} is a tuple with \texttt{subtypes};
      \item \texttt{t\_struct} is a tuple with the structure of each element in \texttt{subtypes};
      \end{itemize}
    \item All of the following apply:
      \begin{itemize}

    \texttt{type T2 of (integer, T1);}
    is the named type \texttt{T2} whose structure is (integer, integer). In this
    example, \texttt{(integer, T1)} is non-primitive since it uses \texttt{T1}, which is builtin aggregate.

    the type of \texttt{x} is the named (hence non-primitive) type \texttt{T1}, whose structure
    is \texttt{integer}.

    In this example:
    \texttt{var y: integer;}
    the type of \texttt{y} is the anonymous primitive type \texttt{integer}.

    In this example:
    \texttt{var z: (integer, T1);}
    the type of \texttt{z} is the anonymous non-primitive type
\texttt{(integer, T1)} whose structure is \texttt{(integer, integer)}.

    \subsection{Code}

    \subsection{Formally}

    \subsection{Comments}
    The structure of a type is the primitive type it is equivalent to such that
    it can hold the same values. 

    This aims to encompass LRM Section 7.1.2 D\_FXQV.

\section{Domain of Values for Types}

\subsection{Prose}
  The domain of a type is the set of values which storage elements of that type
may hold. 

\subsection{Examples}
  The domain of \texttt{integer} is the infinite set of all integers.

  The domain of \texttt{bits(1)} is the set \texttt{{‘1’, ‘0’}}.

  The domain of \texttt{integer {2,16}} is the set containing the integers \texttt{2} and \texttt{16}.

  The domain of \texttt{bits({2,16})} is the set containing all two bit and all sixteen bit values.

\chapter{Type satisfaction and related notions}

\section{TypingRule.Subtype} 

\subsection{Prose}
  The subtype relation is a partial order.

\subsection{Examples}

  \subsection{Code}

  \subsection{Formally}

\subsection{Comments}
  Since the subtype relation is a partial order, it is reflexive, viz, 
  every type is also a subtype of itself.

  Since the subtype relation is a partial order, it is transitive, viz, if A is
  a subtype of B and B is a subtype of C then A is a subtype of C.
 
  As a consequence, there is no need to declare the reflexive and transitive
  subtype relations explicitly. All other subtype relations must be explicitly
  declared.
 
  Since the subtype relation is a partial order, it is antisymmetric. Therefore
  it is an error if all of the following apply:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{id1} is a subtype of \texttt{id2};
  \item \texttt{id2} is a subtype of \texttt{id1}.
  \end{itemize}

  This aims to encompass LRM Section 4.3.1 R\_NXRX, I\_KGKS, I\_MTML, I\_JVRM, I\_CHMP.

\section{TypingRule.Supertype}

  \subsection{Prose}
  \texttt{T} is a supertype of \texttt{S} if and only if \texttt{S} is a subtype of \texttt{T}.

  \subsection{Examples}

  \subsection{Code}

  \subsection{Formally}

  \subsection{Comments}
  Since the subtype relation is a partial order, it is reflexive. Therefore the
  supertype relation also is reflexive, viz, every type is also a supertype of
  itself.

  This aims to encompass LRM Section 4.3.1 I\_KGKS.

\subsection{Example: TypingRule.TypeSatisfaction1.asl}
    In the program:
    \VerbatimInput{../tests/ASLTypingReference.t/TypingRule.TypeSatisfaction1.asl}
    \texttt{var pair: pairT = (1, dataT1)} is legal since the right-hand-side has
    anonymous, non-primitive type \texttt{(integer, T1)}.

\subsection{Example: TypingRule.TypeSatisfaction2.asl}
    In the program:
    \VerbatimInput{../tests/ASLTypingReference.t/TypingRule.TypeSatisfaction2.asl}
    \texttt{pair = (1, dataAsInt);} is legal since the right-hand-side has anonymous,
    primitive type \texttt{(integer, integer)}.
 
\subsection{Example: TypingRule.TypeSatisfaction3.asl}
    In the program:
    \VerbatimInput{../tests/ASLTypingReference.t/TypingRule.TypeSatisfaction3.asl}
    \texttt{pair = (1, dataT2);} is illegal since the right-hand-side has anonymous,
    non-primitive type \texttt{(integer, T2)} which does not subtype-satisfy named
    type \texttt{pairT}.

  \subsection{Formally}

  \subsection{Comments}
  Since the subtype relation is a partial order, it is reflexive. Therefore
  every type \texttt{T} is a subtype of itself, and as a consequence, every type \texttt{T}
  type-satisfies itself.

  \subsection{Examples}

  \subsection{Code}

  \subsection{Formally}

  \subsection{Comments}
  Note that if \texttt{T} subtype-satisfies \texttt{S} then \texttt{T} and \texttt{S} type-clash, but not the other
  way around.

  Note that type-clashing is an equivalence relation. Therefore if \texttt{T}
  type-clashes with \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} then it is also the case that \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} type-clash.

    A local identifier declared with var, let or constant is in scope
from the point immediately after its declaration until the end of the
immediately enclosing block.

    From that follows that we can discard the environment at the end of
an enclosing block.

  \subsection{Prose}
  All of the following apply:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{env1} is \texttt{env} modified to have an empty local environment;
 \item \texttt{env2} is \texttt{env1} with every formal argument declared as immutable with its type;
 \item \texttt{env3} is \texttt{env2} modified to add explicit parameters;
 \item \texttt{env4} is \texttt{env3} modified to resolve dependently typed identifiers in the arguments;
 \item \texttt{env5} is \texttt{env4} modified to resolve dependently typed identifiers in the result type;
 \item \texttt{body} is the body given by \texttt{f};
 \item \texttt{new\_body} is the result of annotating \texttt{body} in \texttt{env5};
 \item \texttt{name} is the name \texttt{f} as found in \texttt{env5}.
