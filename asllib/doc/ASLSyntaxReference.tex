\chapter{Disclaimer}

This document is part of the ASLRef material. 
%It is a snapshot of:
%\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/commit/6dd15fe7833fea24eb94933486d0858038f0c2e8}

This material covers both ASLv0 (viz, the existing ASL pseudocode language
which appears in the Arm Architecture Reference Manual) and ASLv1, a new,
experimental, and as yet unreleased version of ASL.

The development version of ASLRef can be found here \url{~/herdtools7/asllib}.

A list of open items being worked on can be found here
\url{~/herdtools7/asllib/doc/ASLRefProgress.tex}.

This material is work in progress, more precisely at Alpha quality as
per Arm’s quality standards. In particular, this means that it would be
premature to base any production tool development on this material.

However, any feedback, question, query and feature request would be most
welcome; those can be sent to Arm’s Architecture Formal Team Lead Jade Alglave
\texttt{(jade.alglave@arm.com)} or by raising issues or PRs to the herdtools7
github repository.

\chapter{ASL Abstract Syntax}
An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST for short) is a kind of labelled tree. 
A node in an AST is either a leaf, represented by its label, or an internal node of the form $L(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ where $L$ is its label and $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ are its ordered children nodes, which we also refer to as \emph{components}.
Components can be (possibly-empty) lists of nodes, shown as $n^{*}$, and optional nodes (lists of 0 or 1 elements), shown as $n?$. Tuples are shown as $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$.

An abstract syntax is similar to a context-free grammar, but defined over ASTs. A terminal derives leaf nodes while non-terminal use alternatives to derive internal nodes.

A major benefit of employing an abstract syntax is that it allows abstracting away syntactic details that are only important to enable correct parsing, such as punctuation, and succinctly representing lists and optional values. By defining an abstract syntax for ASL, we can uniformly represent programs in ASLv0 as well as ones in ASLv1 and define a single type system for them.

\newcommand\ASTComment[1]{(*\ \textit{#1}\ *)}

We define the abstract syntax of ASL below. We sometimes provide extra details to individual derivations by adding comments below them, in the form \ASTComment{this is a comment}.
