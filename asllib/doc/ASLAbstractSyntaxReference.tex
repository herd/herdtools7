This material covers both ASLv0 (viz, the existing ASL pseudocode language
which appears in the Arm Architecture Reference Manual) and ASLv1, a new,
experimental, and as yet unreleased version of ASL.

This material is work in progress, more precisely at pre-Alpha quality as
per Arm’s quality standards. In particular, this means that it would be
premature to base any production tool development on this material.

However, any feedback, question, query and feature request would be most
welcome; those can be sent to Arm’s Architecture Formal Team Lead Jade

\chapter{Preamble}
An abstract syntax is a form of context-free grammar over structured trees. Compilers and interpreters typically start by parsing the text of a program and producing an abstract syntax tree (AST, for short), and then continue to operate over that tree.
%
The reason for this is that abstract syntax trees abstract away details that are irrelevant to the semantics of the program, such as punctuation and scoping syntax, which are mostly there to facilitate parsing.

A major benefit of employing an abstract syntax for ASL is that it allows us to abstract both the grammar of ASLv0 and the grammar of ASLv1 into a single abstract syntax. This in turn, allows us to define a single type system and a single semantics for both language versions, with very few exceptions\footnote{Note the single appearance of $\version$ in the assignment derivation rule.}.

\section{ASL Abstract Syntax Trees}

In an ASL abstract syntax tree, a node is one the following data types:
\begin{description}
\item[Token Node.] A lexical token, denoted as in the lexical description of ASL;
\item[Label Node.] A label
\item[Unlabelled Tuple Node.] A tuple of children nodes, which we denote as $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$;
\item[Labelled Tuple Node.] A tuple associated with a label $L$, which we denote as $L(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$;
\item[List Node.] A list of 0 or more children nodes, denoted as $[ ]$ when the list is empty and $[n_1,\ldots,n_k]$ for non-empty lists;
\item[Optional.] An optional node stands for a list of 0 or 1 occurrences of a sub-node $n$. We denote an empty optional by $\langle\rangle$ and the non-empty optional by $\langle n \rangle$;
\item[Record Node.] A record, denoted as $\{\text{name}_1 : n_1,\ldots,\text{name}_k : n_k\}$ where $\text{name}_i$, which associates names with corresponding nodes.
\end{description}

\section{ASL Abstract Syntax Grammar}

An abstract syntax is defined in terms of derivation rules containing variables (also referred to as non-terminals).
%
A \emph{derivation rule} has the form $v ::= \textit{rhs}$ where $v$ is a non-terminal variable and \textit{rhs} is a \emph{node type}. We write $n$, $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ to denote node types.
%
Node types are defined recursively as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Non-terminal.] A non-terminal variable;
\item[Terminal.] A lexical token $t$ or a label $L$;
\item[Unlabelled Tuple.] A tuple of node types, which we denote as $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$;
\item[Labelled Tuple.] A tuple associated with a label $L$, which we denote as $L(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$;
\item[List.] A list node type, denoted as $n^{*}$;
\item[Optional.] An optional node type, denoted as $n?$;
\item[Record.] A record, denoted as $\{\text{name}_1 : n_1,\ldots,\text{name}_k : n_k\}$ where $\text{name}_i$, which associates names with corresponding node types.
\end{description}

An abstract syntax consists of a set of derivation rules and a start non-terminal.

\section{ASL Derivation Rules}

The abstract syntax of ASL is given in terms of the derivation rules below and the start non-terminal $\program$.
%
We sometimes provide extra details to individual derivations by adding comments below them, in the form \ASTComment{this is a comment}.

%\chapter{ASL Core}
%
%ASL contains constructs that make it convenient to express functionality, but are not necessarily needed, in the sense that they can be expressed in alternative ways. To simplify the definition of the type system and semantics, we therefore define a subset of the abstract syntax, which we dub \emph{ASL core}. We transform abstract syntax tree in ASL to ASL core, essentially considering the original constructs as syntactic sugar.
%
%We now explain the simplifying transformations of ASL abstract syntax trees to ASL core abstract syntax tree.
%
%A note on typing: once we perform the transformations, typing expressions results only in a type --- there is no need to return a transformed expression, since it was already computed by the simplifying transformation (todo: check how this fits UNKNOWN). I think this will also allow us to avoid transforming statements during annotation.
%
%\section{Getters}
%Getters are simplified into simple functions. 
%
%A getter declaration \texttt{getter $A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$)[$a_1,\ldots,a_n$] => $T$ $B$} 
%is transformed into the function declaration 
%\texttt{func Getter\_$A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$)($a_1,\ldots,a_n$) => $T$ $B$}.
%
%A no-arg getter \texttt{getter $A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$) => $T$ $B$}
%is transformed into the function declaration 
%\texttt{func NoArgGetter\_$A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$)() => $T$ $B$}.
%
%Subprogram invocations examine the symbol table to match the right function name.
%An invocation $A[e_1,\ldots,e_n]$ is transformed into \texttt{Getter\_$A(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$} and 
%an invocation $A$ is transformed into \texttt{NoArgGetter\_$A()$}.
%
%\section{Setters}
%Setters are also simplified into functions.
%
%A setter declaration \texttt{setter $A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$)[$a_1,\ldots,a_n$] = $\id$ : $T$ $B$} 
%is transformed into the function declaration 
%\texttt{func Setter\_$A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$)($a_1,\ldots,a_n, \id$:$T$) $B$}.
%
%A no-arg setter declaration \texttt{setter $A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$) = $\id$ : $T$ $B$} 
%is transformed into the function declaration 
%\texttt{func NoArgSetter\_$A$($p_1,\ldots,p_k$)($\id$:$T$) $B$}.
%
%Subprogram invocations examine the symbol table to match the right function name.
%An invocation $A[e_1,\ldots,e_n] = e$ is transformed into \texttt{Setter\_$A(e_1,\ldots,e_n, e)$} and 
%an invocation $A = e$ is transformed into \texttt{NoArgSetter\_$A(e)$}.
%
%\section{Case Statements}
%We simplify case statements into a compound conditional statement where each case alternative is represented by a sub-conditional. Also, we precede the case statement with an assignment of the test expression into a temporary variable.
%
%\section{Patterns}
%
%We simplify \texttt{IN} test patterns as suggested in \texttt{Typing.ml}:
%\begin{verbatim}
% e IN pattern            is sugar for
%    "-"                      ->          TRUE
%  | e1=expr                  ->          e == e1
%  | bitmask_lit              ->          use match_bitmask
%  | e1=expr ".." e2=expr     ->          e1 <= e && e <= e2
%  | "<=" e1=expr             ->          e <= e1
%  | ">=" e1=expr             ->          e >= e1
%  |  { p0 , ... pN }         ->          e IN p0 || ... e IN pN
%  | !{ p0 , ... pN }         ->          not (e IN p0) && ... e IN pN
%
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\subsection{Matching Bitmasks}
%
%We first introduce the new built-in function:
%\begin{verbatim}
%// Tests whether bits is equal to definite_mask 
%// on all indices where x_mask is 0.
%func match_bitmask{N}(x: bits(N), 
%                      definite_mask: bits(N),
%                      x_mask: bits(N)) => boolean
%begin
%  for i = 1 to N do
%  	if !x_mask[i] && definite_mask[i] != x[i] then
%  		return FALSE;
%  end
%  return TRUE;
%end
%\end{verbatim}
%
%We transform an expression \texttt{$e$ IN $m$} where $m$ is a bitmask literal into the function call \texttt{match\_bitmask($e$, $m_d$, $m_x$} where $m_d$ is $m$ where every appearance of \texttt{x} is substituted with \texttt{0} and $m_x$ is $m$ where every appearance of \texttt{x} is substituted with \texttt{1} and every appearance of \texttt{1} is substituted with \texttt{0}.
%
%%\section{For Statements}
%%We transform for statements into assign-loop statements.
%
%\section{Discard Assignments}
%We replace a left-hand side discard assignment \texttt{- = $e$} with an assignment \texttt{DiscardV$n$ = $E$} assignment where $n$ is a fresh integer.
%
%\section{Local Declaration Tuples}
%We can expand declaration of tuples into a sequence of declaration of individual variables.
%
%%\section{Tuples}
%%We simplify tuples into records.
%%--> This won't work, since records and tuples behave differently when it comes to subtype-satisfaction.
%
%\section{Constants and Configurations}
%
%One the program configuration is loaded, each configuration variable is replaced with a corresponding \texttt{let} variable, initialized with the value given by the program configuration.
%
%The values of constant declarations (both global and local) are substituted wherever their names are used.
%
%\section{Slices}
%
%We simplify an expression \texttt{$e_1$+:$e_2$} into an expression \texttt{$e_1$:($e_1$+$e_2$-1)}.
%%
%We simplify an expression \texttt{$e_1$*:$e_2$} into an expression \texttt{($e_1$*$e_2$):($e_1$*$e_2$+$e_2$-1)}.
%
%This leaves us with only one kind of range expression $a:b$.
%
%One issue is that we duplicate expressions, which we may want to avoid for efficiency (both of interpretation and verification) reasons. To achieve this, we can introduce \texttt{let x = $e_!$ in $e_2$} expressions.
%
%\section{Field Access}
%...
%
%\section{LE expressions}
%Setting slice(s), field/fields, destructuring...
