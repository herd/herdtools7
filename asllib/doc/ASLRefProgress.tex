\chapter{Not implemented in ASLRef}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter describes what is not yet present in the executable version of ASLRef.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Syntax}

\subsection{Constrained bitvectors}

Constrained bitvectors are not yet implemented in ASLRef.

For example, the following function is not understood by ASLRef:
\begin{Verbatim}
func foo(x: bits({3, 5})) => integer
begin
  return Len(x) * 2;
end
\end{Verbatim}
%
Here the length of the formal argument \Verb|x| needs to be declared as a
parameter, for example as follows:
\begin{Verbatim}
func foo {N: integer {3, 5}} (x: bits(N)) => integer
begin
  return Len(x) * 2;
end
\end{Verbatim}
%
This also applies to bitvectors constrained by a type.

This is related to \identr{FHYZ}, \identr{VBMX}, \identr{XVWK}, \identr{PMQB},
\identr{VCZX}, \identi{TZVJ}, \identi{GLWM}, \identi{MTWL}, \identr{QYZD},
\identi{NFBN}, \identr{LJBG}, \identi{YBHF}, \identr{FZSD}.

\subsection{Guards}

Guards are used on \texttt{case} and \texttt{catch} statements, to restrict
matching on the evaluation of a boolean expression.
%
They are not yet implemented in ASLRef.

This relates to \identr{WGSY}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Typing}

Note that as it stands, the type system of ASL is not sound.
Our proposal can be found at: 
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/pull/747}

This is related to \identi{JSKW}.

\subsection{Immutability of expressions in constraint ranges}

The constraints of an integer type should be \emph{constrained},
\emph{statically evaluable expressions}, i.\,e.\ the variables used by
expressions describing an integer constraint should be immutable and of a
constrained type, and those expressions should be side-effect-free.

Furthermore, those constraints should not include Checked Type Conversions.

This also applies to bitvector widths.

This is related to \identr{BSMK}, \identr{LSNP}, \identr{GHRP}, \identr{LVTH},
\identi{ZLZC}, \identr{RHTN}, \identr{XNBN}, \identi{GQYG}.

\subsection{Sound domains for under-constrained integers}

Under-constrained integers have for the moment the same domain.
%
This makes the type-system unsound, as one can assign one under-constrained
integer to another.
%

This is related to \identi{JSKW}.

\subsection{Statically evaluable programs}%
\label{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}

Side effects analysis has not been implemented yet.
%
This makes detection of statically evaluable subprograms impossible.

Furthermore, non-execution time subprograms, expressions, and types have not
been implemented.

This is related to \identi{LZCX}, \identi{NXJR}, \identr{CSFT}, \identi{HYBT},
\identd{CCTY}, \identi{LYKD}, \identi{ZPWM}, \identd{KCKX}, \identi{NTYZ},
\identi{MSZT}, \identd{QNHM}, \identi{XYKC}, \identd{ZPMF}, \identi{XSDY},
\identd{XRBT}, \identi{WVGG}, \identd{JLJD}, \identi{KKDY}, \identd{MTQJ},
\identi{YBGL}, \identi{YMRT}, \identi{QJTN}, \identi{GFZT}.

\subsection{Precise implementation of parameters type-checking}

The code handling parameter type-checking at a function declaration is not
safe: some checks are missing.

Furthermore, the handling of formal arguments that should be considered as
parameters is also not finished.

This is related to \identi{BLVP}, \identr{RKBV}, \identi{TQGH}.

\subsection{Restriction on use of under-constrained types}

\subsubsection{As storage types}
Restrictions on use of under-constrained types as storage element types are not
implemented.

This is related to \identr{ZCVD}.

\subsubsection{As expression with a constrained type}

Restriction on the use of under-constrained parameters as left-hand-side of a
Checked Typed Conversion is not implemented in ASLRef.
%
For example, the following will not raise a type-error:
\VerbatimInput[firstline=3,lastline=8]{../tests/asl.t/under-constrained-used.asl}

This is related to \identi{TBHH}, \identr{ZDKC}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Real exponentiation}

The exponentiation operation \texttt{exp\_real} has not been implemented.
%
Note: this would construct non-rational numbers which are not supported by
ASLRef, e.\,g.\ $2^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{2}$.

This is related to \identr{BNCY}.

\section{Typing}

\subsection{Domains}

The formalization of type domains is complete for all types.
In particular, it addresses the weakness with under-constrained integers.
The definition is still weak when it comes to bitvectors of undetermined width (\url{text}).
This will be addressed by a future proposal.

\subsection{Global storage declarations}

Global storage declarations are transliterated.
The formal rules need a bit more refinement (e.g., defining \texttt{declare\_const} and \texttt{reduce\_constants}).

This is related to \identr{FWQM}.

\subsection{Statically evaluable expressions}

The part of statically evaluable expressions that has been implemented in
ASLRef (see Section~\ref{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}) has not
been transliterated.

Equivalence of statically evaluable expressions has been implemented in a
restricted setting (see
Section~\ref{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}).
%
Mainly, expressions that reduce to polynomials can be checked for equivalence.
%
This has not been transliterated either.

This is related to \identr{PKXK}, \identd{YYDW}, \identd{CWVH}, \identd{HLQC},
and \identi{LHLR}, \identr{RFQP}, \identr{VNKT}.

\subsection{Polymorphism}

Polymorphism in ASL is the ability to have multiple subprograms with the same
name that do not have the same signature.

Although polymorphism is implemented in ASLRef, it has not yet been
transliterated.

This is related to \identd{BTBR}, \identi{FSFQ}, \identi{FCTB}, \identi{PFGQ},
\identr{PGFC}, \identi{BTMT}.

\subsection{Calls to setters and getters}

The replacement of implicit calls to getters and setters (written for example as
slices) to explicit calls to subprograms has not been transliterated.
%
In terms of abstract syntax, this corresponds to the translation between a
\texttt{E\_Slice} and a \texttt{E\_Call}.

This is related to \identi{YYQX}, \identi{LJLW}, \identi{MFBC}.

\subsection{Type inference from literals}

Finding the type of a literal value, or a compile-time constant expression, is
not yet transliterated.

This is related to \identr{ZJKY} and \identi{RYRP}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Base values of types}

Finding the base value of a type is not transliterated.

This is related to \identr{NJDZ}, \identr{CFTD}, \identr{QGGH}, \identi{WVQZ},
\identr{GYCG}, \identr{WKCY}, \identr{LCCN}, \identr{CPCK}, \identr{ZVPT},
\identi{QFZH}, \identr{ZGVR}, \identi{PGSS}, \identr{QWSQ}, \identr{HMRK},
\identr{MBRM}, \identr{SVJB}.

\subsection{Operations}

Operations are not transliterated from ASLRef.

This is related to \identr{NCWM}, \identr{VGZF}, \identr{THSV}, \identr{CRQJ},
\identr{ZTJN}, \identr{SVMM}, \identr{WWTV}, \identr{GHXR}, \identi{NBCT}.

\subsection{Standard library and primitives}

The standard library is not transliterated.

This is related to \identr{RXYN}.

Side-Effects are not yet considered in ASLRef.
