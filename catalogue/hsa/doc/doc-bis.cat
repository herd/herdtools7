(* Generate actual total SC orders for each dynamic scope instance.
   In practice we generate one set of relations per scope level,
   using the cross function. Each relation in such a set is the union
   of orders on all dynamic scope instances at this level.
   The dynamic scope instances are the equivalence classes of their level,
   as computed by the new primitive classes, which takes an equivalence
   relation as argument and returns the set of its equivalence classes *)
