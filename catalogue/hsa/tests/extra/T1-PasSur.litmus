(*

o   Assuming work-items release to agent scope when complete:

§  dispatch work items could do an atomic_st_screl_agent to hidden variable
provided by packet processor

·         probably do a rmw to a single counter

§  packet processor does atomic_ld_acq_agent on that variable so gets all data
written by dispatch

·         probably spin until counter to wait for whole dispatch to complete

§  packet processor would do memfence_screl_system if indicated by packet release fence

§  packet processor then does an atomic_st_rlx_system to completion signal

§  host (or other) thread does atomic_ld_rlx_system on completion signal

§  host (or other) thread can do a memfence_scacq_system if want to access generated data of dispatch

o   Does this model result in correct semantics given current memory model?
