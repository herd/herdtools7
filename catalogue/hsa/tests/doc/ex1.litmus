(*
p. 67/84:

Synchronizing operations are sequentially consistent by definition, and thus
outcomes that violate sequential consistency are not allowed. In this example
the following outcomes \sout{are} is not allowed:

\sout{$s1=0, $s2=1 & $s3=0, $s4=1}
$s1=1, $s2=0 & $s3=1, $s4=0

Sequential consistency implies that units of execution C and D must observe X
and Y changing from 0 to 1 in the same order.
