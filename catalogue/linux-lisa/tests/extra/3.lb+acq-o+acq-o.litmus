(*More precisely, Paul says:

  See lb+acq-o+acq-o.litmus.

And:

        The reason for saying "OK" is because C11 and C++11 would allow
        this cycle -- no "synchronizes-with" relationship.  The reason
        I might care is that it would be good to be able to map at least
        some of the Linux kernel primitives into C11.  ;-)
        This would mean that lb+o-rel+o-rel would also be allowed, in
        contrast to our discussions last week.
