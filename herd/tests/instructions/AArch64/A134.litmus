AArch64 A134
(* tests storing  a location outside of the array bounds, but next to the array *)
(* so we can have abstract memory locations which are logically 'next' to each other*)
(* this means we can have both symbolic 'flatmaps' of memory, using
the address_of operator *)
(* symbolic locations *)

(* THIS IS PROBLEMATIC - same syntax problem as A130 *)
