(* Tests ADRP, given a concrete location, decimal value*)
(* This is interesting as we must infer the address from a label*)
(* We don't encode a notion of page boundaries yet, but we should *)
(* This variant is not strictly part of the arm arm, but a convenience*)
(* so we can parse numeric addresses easily inline - useful for testing *)
(* disassembly, call herd with -variant allow_numeric_literals  *)
