If all of the following apply:
* the Implicit Instruction Memory Read Effect (d) is Ordered-before
  the Explicit Memory Write Effect (b) (given that Effect (d) is
  Instruction-read-ordered-before the Explicit Memory Write Effect (a),
  and the DMB ST Effect (i) appears in program order between Effect (a) and Effect (b)).
* the Implicit Instruction Memory Read Effect (c) appears in program order before Effect (d).
then Effect (c) is not architecturally Allowed to Read-from Effect (b).
