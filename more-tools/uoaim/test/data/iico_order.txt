There is an Intrinsic Order Dependency from an Effect E1 to an Effect E2 if and only if all of the following apply:
* E1 is a Memory Effect.
* E1 and E2 are generated by the same instruction I.
* The instruction semantics for that instruction I indicate that E1 is generated before E2.
* It is not the case that there is an Intrinsic Data Dependency from E1 to E2.
* It is not the case that there is an Intrinsic Control Dependency from E1 to E2.
* E2 is a Memory Effect.
