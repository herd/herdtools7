The tool \jingle{} is a litmus test converter.
It translates tests from one architecture to another.
For instance a LISA test may be translated into an AArch64 (or ARMv8)~test.


\section{Writing conversions rules}
Translation is directed by user-specified conversion rules.
All conversion rules of a specific (\emph{i.e.} one architecture
to another) are regrouped in a specific ``theme'' file.


\subsection{Mimimal conversion rules}
A theme file starts by specifying source and target architectures.
For instance:
\begin{verbatim}
LISA to AArch64
\end{verbatim}

Then conversion rules follow. For instance here are two rules
that translate LISA loads and stores to AArch64 loads and stores:
\begin{verbatim}
"r[] %x %y" -> "LDR %x,[%y]"

"w[] %x %y" -> "STR %y,[%x]"
\end{verbatim}
More generally, conversions rules are akin to rewrite
rules~$\myquoted{L} \texttt{->} \myquoted{R}$.
In the simplest case,
a rule associates a source instruction pattern~$L$
to a target instruction pattern~$R$.
Patterns may contain identifiers, which are bound to concrete items
during matching.
Identifiers starting with the character~``\verb+%+" represent registers.

The above rules suffice to translate the LISA (register indirect)
load instruction ``\verb+r[] r0 r1+
into the equivalent AArch64 instruction~``\verb+LDR R3,[R4]+''.
Observe that registers are translated.
Here LISA~\verb+r0+ and~\verb+r1+
are translated into  AArch64 \verb+R3+ and~\verb+R4+.
If a later LISA instruction uses, say, \verb+r1+ again,
that register will be translated to the same AArch64 register~\verb+R4+.
As a result, the sequence \verb+r[] r0 r1; w[] r2 r1+ will get
translated to \verb+LDR R3,[R4]; STR R5,[R4]+.


\subsection{More on identifiers}
There are additional categories of identifiers:

Identifiers starting with~``\verb+&+ represent constants.
For instance, the following rule translates register load by a constant:
\begin{verbatim}
"mov %r &c" -> "MOV %r,&c"
\end{verbatim}

Identifiers starting with an alphabetical letter represent memory locations.
Consider for instance the following LISA to AArch64 converstion rule:
\begin{verbatim}
"w[] x %r" -> "STR %r,[%x]"
\end{verbatim}
The identifier~``\verb+x+'' will match any symbol.
In LISA, such symbols embedded in code are memory locations.
By constrast modern architectures, such as AArch64, do
not permit to embed memory addresses in code.
As a consequence, the matched symbolic location from the left hand-side
pattern is replaced by a register, written ``\verb+%x+'' above.
The tool \jingle{} will initialise the corresponding AArch64 register
appropriately.
For instance the LISA instruction \verb+w[] z r0+ will get translated
to say \verb+STR R1,[R2]+, with \verb+R2+ initial value being specified
as~\verb+z+ in the final target litmus test.



\subsection{Multiple instructions patterns}
Sometimes, a single instruction with a couple of symbolic registers
is not nearly enough to express every conversion in a good fashion.

A single rule ought to be enough for anybody to understand:
\begin{verbatim}
"w[] x &c" -> "MOV %tmp,&c;
               STR %tmp,[%x]"
\end{verbatim}

In AArch64, it is not possible to directly store a constant value in memory,
thus we have to express the LISA instruction in two AArch64 instructions
with a register picked on the fly.

This example illustrates at the same time:
\begin{itemize}
\item how to identify addresses for languages which can directly mention it,
such as LISA, where they are simply represented by a name. An address can
be converted to a register which would contain the said address value.
\item how to identify constants. For every assembly language, a constant can be
represented by a name preceded by the character \verb+&+.
\item how to define patterns with multiple instructions by separating them
with a semicolon.
\item that identifiers are not necessarily bound to appear on both sides of
a rule if they are only needed in one.
\end{itemize}

In case of ambiguity, \jingle{} choose the rule to apply according to their order
in the file: the higher the rule, the higher its priority.

\subsection{Multiple level pattern and structured languages}
The last section covers what is necessary to convert most tests from any assembly language
to another. However, we might want to allow our tool to work on higher level languages.

The suite currently supports a relevant subset of the C language.
That means our tool must not only convert sequences of instructions but also
potential control structures.

For this purpose, we must allow the expression of chunks of code:

\begin{verbatim}
C to LISA

"if(x==constvar:c)
   codevar:t;
 else
   codevar:e;"     -> "mov %test (eq %x &c);
                      b[] %test then;
                      codevar:e;
                      b[] 1 end;
                      then : codevar:t;
                      end :"
\end{verbatim}

This awfully looks like a compilation process (and it is!), but in practice,
conditionals are used to express control dependencies which can have a much
simpler form in assembly code.

Now, the important point here is the use of \verb+codevar:+ to state that
arbitrary code is expected. Such code will also be converted by the same
given set of rules, thus allowing us to convert arbitrarily deep code.

Notice that labels too are subject to identification and that is
perfectly fine to end a pattern with it since the tool will see
a nop-like instruction.

The special keyword \verb+constvar:+ is used in C for the obvious reason
that \verb+&+ has an entirely different meaning.

\section{Rewriting algorithm}
Now with a well defined file, we can let the burden of converting our
thousands of tests to \jingle{}.

In order to fully understand its behaviour, we shall explore
more in detail its mechanisms.

\subsection{Rule application and substitution mechanism}
The rules we define are nothing but generic patterns, for them
to hold any meaning we have to find an application in the source program.
Such application is simply an instance of the conversion of a part
of the source program. The source part must match the pattern in the
left side of the rule, the instance of the conversion is the code
defined in the right side plus a set of what we call substitutions.

The substitutions are the link between the identifiers in the rule
and their actual representations in both the source and target programs.

To roughly formalise,
$App(R, P) = \left(R_{right}, \left\{\left(id,Src_{id},Tgt_{id}\right) \mid id \text{is an identifier of} R\right\}\right)$
would be the application of the rule $R$ on a part of the source program $P$,
where $P$ is a possible instance of $R_{left}$ and $Src_{id}$ ($Tgt_{id}$) is the source
(respectively the target) representation.

\subsection{Linear processing}
Now that we have a first step of local rewriting, we want to convert an entire
program. Thanks to relative simplicity of the supported languages, decomposing
a source program linearly is a good enough approach for our needs.

The process can be divided in two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item The actual decomposition of the source program into a sequence of rule applications.
\item The recomposition into a target program by instancing the previous sequence
according to its substitutions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Decomposing}
The program is decomposed with a greedy algorithm
applying the rules according to their priority order.

A recursive definition would be:
\begin{align*}
& Decomp(\bullet,Rs) = \bullet && where R is the highest possible element of the rule set Rs\\
& Decomp(P | Source_{rest},Rs) = App(R,P) | Decomp(Source_{rest},Rs) && and P \in Instances(R_{left})
\end{align*}

Of course, we assume the given rule set is sufficient to assure that all parts of the
program will be matched. If not, users have to refine it.

\paragraph{Recomposing}
With the result of the previous step, which already looks like a converted program,
we have to actually substitute the abstract identifiers for their representation
in the target language given by the associated substitutions, for each part.
Then simply append the results to one another in order.

\begin{align*}
& Recomp(\bullet) = \bullet\\
& Recomp((R_{right}, Subs) | Parts_{rest}) = R_{right}[\{id \mapsto Tgt_{id} \mid (id,Src_{id},Tgt_{id})\in Subs\}] | Recomp(Parts_{rest})
\end{align*}

\begin{remark}
The substitutions can also include code since patterns allow it. This code is converted following the same
procedure thus any code substitution have the form $(id,Src_{id},Recomp(Decomp(Src_{id},Rs)))$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Representation coherence and environment}
There is one key aspect that we have yet to cover. Until now, the coherence between the source and target representation of
a substitution in regards to the others was assumed, i.e.:
\begin{equation*}
\forall id_1,id_2, \; Src_{id_1} = Src_{id_2} \Rightarrow Tgt_{id_1} = Tgt_{id_2}
\end{equation*}
However, if this property in the substitutions of a single application is given by the rule itself,
ensuring it between different applications is not as obvious because it would not make sense to
compare pattern identifiers from different rules. Thus, we need to keep track of any $Src,Tgt$
association made by applications through the whole program.

To do so, we define a global environment that preserves the property by delivering a target
language representation for each source value:
\begin{align*}
& Get\_repr(\Gamma,Src_{id}) = fresh\_repr(Src_{id}) & if Src_{id} \notin \Gamma\\
& Get\_repr(Src_{id}\mapsto Tgt_{id}\mid\Gamma,Src_{id}) = Tgt_{id} &
\end{align*}

Nothing exotic here, this is a part of the application of a rule as it is supposed
to be the only safe way to obtain a target representation.

\section{Example}

Considering the LISA litmus test
\afile{MP+poplainplain+fencedmballsyplainplain.litmus}:

\verbatiminput{MP+poplainplain+fencedmballsyplainplain.litmus}

and the theme file \afile{BelltoAArch64.theme} in which the
only relevant rules, in regards of the test above, are:

\begin{verbatim}
"r[] %x y" -> "LDR %x,[%y]"

"w[] x &c" -> "MOV %tmp,&c;
               STR %tmp,[%x]"

"f[dmb,all,sy]" -> "DMB SY"
\end{verbatim}

the output of a call to \jingle{} with those in arguments will be:
\begin{verbatim}
AArch64 MP+poplainplain+fencedmballsyplainplain
"PodWWPlainPlain RfePlainPlain FenceDmbAllSydRRPlainPlain FrePlainPlain"
Mapping=1:X2=r1,1:X0=r0
Hash=6945a3af44248d1d826a14b204ccf067
Cycle=RfePlainPlain FenceDmbAllSydRRPlainPlain FrePlainPlain PodWWPlainPlain
Relax=
Safe=Rfe Fre PodWW FencedRR
Prefetch=0:x=F,0:y=W,1:y=F,1:x=T
Com=Rf Fr
Orig=PodWWPlainPlain RfePlainPlain FenceDmbAllSydRRPlainPlain FrePlainPlain

{0:X1=y; 0:X0=x; 1:X3=x; 1:X1=y;}

 P0          | P1          ;
 MOV X2,#1   | LDR X0,[X1] ;
 STR X2,[X0] | DMB SY      ;
 MOV X2,#1   | LDR X2,[X3] ;
 STR X2,[X1] |             ;



exists (1:X0=1 /\ 1:X2=0)
\end{verbatim}

According to the algorithm described in the last section,
\jingle{} has converted the three instructions of P1 with,
in order, the load rule, the fence rule and the load again.
For P0 it applies the store rule twice.

Notice that the same AArch64 register \verb+X2+ is used as
the temporary register for both applications. It is safe to do so
as long as  its value is not needed but outside the scope
of each application.

The initialisation and test conditions are converted as well:
the registers are from the right architecture and
the location, directly used in LISA, is now bound to
specific registers.

A \verb+Mapping+ metadatum is also added to allow comparison tools
to work properly.

\section{Usage of \jingle{}}

\subsection{Arguments}
The command \jingle{} handles its arguments as file names, just as \herd{}.
Those files are either a single litmus test when having extension .litmus,
or a list of file names when prefixed by @.

\subsection{Options}
There is one option that must always be used:

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt -theme <name>}] Read the conversion rules file <name>.
By convention, such files have the extension \verb+.theme+.
\end{description}

\paragraph{General behaviour}
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt -v}] Be verbose.
\item[{\tt -o <dest>}] Instead of printing the result on the standard output,
output test files in the existing <dest> directory. Those files have the same
name as the input tests.
\end{description}

\subsection{Regarding conversion errors}
When the tool fails to find a conversion in a program, it will print the remaining instructions.
It makes it easy for the user to pin down missing rules in his \verb+.theme+ file
as the first instruction printed is likely the one that cannot be matched.

Using those error might be helpful to build such file instead of trying to figure it out
as a whole beforehand.
