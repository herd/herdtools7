This is a snapshot of the development version.

To compile and install in your home directory (binaries -> $HOME/bin,
library files -> $HOME/lib), just type "make luc" at the root of
the source tree. Then, provided you have $HOME/bin in your path,
all diy commands (such as litmus, diy etc.) can be invoked.
