== overview ==

The idea is to piggyback on top of herd while being minimally
intrusive, using js_of_ocaml magic.

The main challenge is that herd operates on input and output
files. Inside the browser, we don't such luxuries as disk
access. js_of_ocaml lets us redirect stdout and stderr, but not writes
to files (here, dot files). The idea is to output the content that
would have been written into dot files on stdout instead when called
from the web.

Another challenge is that herd keeps some internal state based on the
assumption that herd is called in a one-off fashion, as from the
command line. The remedy will be a healthy dose of hacks for now.


== dependencies to build the website ==

# ocaml
# js_of_ocaml

== how to add a book ==

1. add your book to ../catalogue/[book]

2. write a shelf.py there

3. add an entry in the "Books" dropdown menu from www/index.html:
   <li><a href="#" onclick="readRecord('[book]', '[some book name]');">[some book name]</a></li>

4. add book to Makefile

5. run make

== how to add cat includes ==

1. create or make a symbolic link to your cat file in cat_includes/

2. run make

== TODO ==
 
- changer le display des evts e.g. W() x 1 -> W[] x 1
- les show et le co sont tous les deux en marron par defaut; il faudrait peut
  etre changer la couleur par defaut du co (bleu) et garder marron pour les
  show, ou l'inverse
- dire a jerd ou herd est builde en local
- display funky a regler
- support loading cfgs from shelf
- read includes from shelf
- cache downloads
- books with bookblock js animations
  http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/09/03/bookblock-a-content-flip-plugin/
- book id + litmus id ... in GET params
- make private e.g. if we have a secret nvidia book, it deploys the book at a secret url with username/pwd
- size of dot figures might be an issue (1-col possible when herd output becomes optional)
- upload files to server (get in back w/ GET params only)
- parse herd output and make shiny histograms (text output as option only)
- have header of litmus tests in panel title and change syntax highlighting (eg, "C MP1" -> C syntax, title=MP1)
- similarly for other files where relevant
- input user file as cat/bell/litmus
- replace includes by checkboxes + links to read-only code of each possible include
- resize input boxes?
- CI test for collections of litmuses (in the form Allowed/Forbidden)
- possiblity to upload/write several litmus tests for a single cat/bell/include combo
- shinify website
- add spinner when herd is running
- add progress bars for large js modules download
- add some herd-specific keywords to Ace themes
- tutorial
- splash-screen to redirect either to tutorial or experiments
- look how it looks without JavaScript on
- test other browsers
